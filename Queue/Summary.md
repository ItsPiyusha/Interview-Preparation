## 🧩 1. Implement Queue using Stack

- Implement Queue using Stack – [LeetCode #232](https://leetcode.com/problems/implement-queue-using-stacks/)

---

## 🔄 2. Circular Queue

- Design Circular Queue – [LeetCode #622](https://leetcode.com/problems/design-circular-queue/)

---

## 🔁 3. Sliding Window Problems (Implemented using Queue/Deque)

- Sliding Window Maximum – [LeetCode #239](https://leetcode.com/problems/sliding-window-maximum/)
- First Negative Integer in Every Window of Size K – [GFG](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/first-negative-integer-every-window-size-k/)
- Maximum of all subarrays of size k – [GFG](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/sliding-window-maximum/)

## 🔃 4. Rotting Oranges (Multi-source BFS)

- Rotting Oranges – [LeetCode #994](https://leetcode.com/problems/rotting-oranges/)

---

## 🔄 5. Number of Recent Calls (Fixed Time Window using Queue)

- Number of Recent Calls – [LeetCode #933](https://leetcode.com/problems/number-of-recent-calls/)

---

## 🔀 6. Interleaving Queue

- Interleave the first half of the queue with the second half – [GFG](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/interleave-first-half-queue-second-half/)

---

## 🌪 7. Reversing Queue

- Reverse First K Elements of Queue – [GFG](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/reverse-first-k-elements-queue/)

---

## 📥 8. Generate Binary Numbers

- Generate binary numbers from 1 to N using queue – [GFG](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/generate-binary-numbers-1-n-using-queue/)

---

## 🧼 9. Clean Up Duplicates (or simulate queues)

- Dota2 Senate – [LeetCode #649](https://leetcode.com/problems/dota2-senate/)
- Reveal Cards In Increasing Order – [LeetCode #950](https://leetcode.com/problems/reveal-cards-in-increasing-order/)

---

## 📌 Queue Variants to Practice:

- Deque (Double-ended Queue)
- Priority Queue (Min Heap / Max Heap)

---

## 🧠 Tips:

- Use `deque` from `collections` in Python for both queue and deque.
- Queue is often used with BFS or level-order traversal.
- Learn STL `queue`, `deque`, `priority_queue` in C++.
