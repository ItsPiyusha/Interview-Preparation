# ðŸ§µ Trie (Prefix Tree) Patterns in DSA

Tries are specialized tree-based data structures used to store associative data structures where keys are usually strings. Great for **prefix-based searches**, **autocomplete systems**, and **dictionary-related problems**.

---

## ðŸª¢ Core Concepts

- Each node represents a character of a word.
- Words are stored from root to leaf.
- Typically implemented with arrays/maps for 26 lowercase English letters (or more for Unicode).
- Supports insert, search, and delete operations.

## ðŸ“š Basic Template

```cpp
struct TrieNode {
    TrieNode* links[26]; // or unordered_map<char, TrieNode*>
    bool isEnd = false;
};

class Trie {
public:
    TrieNode* root;
    
    Trie() {
        root = new TrieNode();
    }

    void insert(string word) {
        TrieNode* node = root;
        for (char ch : word) {
            if (!node->links[ch - 'a']) 
                node->links[ch - 'a'] = new TrieNode();
            node = node->links[ch - 'a'];
        }
        node->isEnd = true;
    }

    bool search(string word) {
        TrieNode* node = root;
        for (char ch : word) {
            if (!node->links[ch - 'a']) return false;
            node = node->links[ch - 'a'];
        }
        return node->isEnd;
    }
};


# ðŸ”¤ Trie (Prefix Tree) Patterns â€“ Important Questions

Tries are useful for efficiently storing and searching strings, especially for prefix-based queries. This is a key data structure in problems involving dictionaries, auto-complete, and word searches.

## âœ… Core Concepts:
- Each node represents a character.
- Paths from root to leaf represent words.
- Great for prefix lookups.
- Space-optimized using arrays or hashmaps.

## ðŸ”‘ Pattern 6: **Palindrome Pairs**
Store reverse strings in a trie to match palindromic prefixes/suffixes.

- [Palindrome Pairs](https://leetcode.com/problems/palindrome-pairs/)

---

## ðŸ”‘ Pattern 7: **Advanced Applications**
Combining Trie with DFS, DP, or Bitmask for enhanced performance.

## ðŸ“Œ Tips:
- Use `unordered_map<char, Node*>` for generic Trie.
- Use arrays (`Node* children[26]`) for lowercase English letters.
- Keep a `bool isEnd` flag at each node.
- Trie + DFS is powerful for board-based search problems.
- Memory-heavy; optimize with shared prefixes or compressed tries if needed.
