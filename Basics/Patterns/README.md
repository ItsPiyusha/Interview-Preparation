# ⭐ Pattern Printing Master Summary

## 🧠 What to Look For in Each Pattern

1. **Number of Rows (`n`)**
2. **What gets printed?** (Stars, Numbers, Alphabets)
3. **How many times per row?**
4. **Are spaces used for alignment?**
5. **Is the shape symmetric?** (Pyramid, Diamond)

|-------------------------|----------------------------------------|------------------------------------|
| Row-wise stars (simple) | `j <= i` or `j < i`                    | Increasing triangles               |
| Row-wise decreasing     | `j < n - i`                            | Decreasing triangles               |
| Spaces before stars     | `n - i - 1` or `n - row`               | Centered pyramids                  |
| Pyramid width           | `2*i - 1` or `2*row + 1`               | Full pyramids or diamond shapes    |
| Number sequence         | `j + 1`, `i + 1`, or counter `++`      | Number triangles                   |
| Alphabet sequence       | `'A' + j`, `char('A' + i)`             | Alphabet-based patterns            |
| Diamond logic           | Combine pyramid (top) + reverse (bottom) | Diamond patterns                |

## ✅ Common Pattern Types and How to Solve

### 1. Left-Aligned Increasing Triangle

yaml
Copy
Edit

- Outer loop: `i = 0 to n-1`
- Inner loop: `j = 0 to i` → print `*`

---

### 2. Right-Aligned Triangle

### 3. Full Pyramid

### 4. Inverted Pyramid

### 5. Diamond

- Top: Same as full pyramid
- Bottom: Same as inverted pyramid

### 6. Number Pattern

1
1 2
1 2 3

yaml

- Print `j + 1` or `counter++`

---

### 7. Alphabet Pattern

A
A B
A B C

yaml

- Print `char('A' + j)`

## 🪄 Tips to Solve Pattern Questions

- Dry run for `n = 3` or `n = 4`
- Divide row into:
  - Spaces
  - Stars/Numbers/Characters
- Identify:
  - Count of elements → `j`
  - Alignment → `spaces`
- Modify loop bounds and spacing to create mirrored or reversed shapes
- Use `"* "` for spaced shapes, `"*"` for tight ones

---

## ✅ Practice Strategy

- Practice **1 pattern daily**.
- Vary loops: `i` from `0 or 1`, `j` conditions
- Create Markdown loop analysis tables
- Try changing space & star logic incrementally

# Why Pattern Printing Matters in DSA
Fundamental building block: Helps master nested loops, spacing logic, and control flow.

Logical thinking: Visualizes output before coding—key for more complex DSA challenges.

Often assessed in entrance-level interviews to test coding fluency and problem breakdown.

# Key Strategy: How to Approach a Pattern Problem
From Reddit and GfG discussions, here are proven tactics to tackle pattern printing systematically:


Draw the pattern manually for a small n (e.g., n=5).

Break it down row by row: count stars, spaces, or characters.

Map indices → values: translate row & column to what should display.

Nested loops structure: outer for rows, inner for columns, with conditions.

Build incrementally: Start with a fixed pattern, then generalize to n.

Validate edge cases: n=1, even vs. odd sizes, large inputs.





# DSA Pattern Printing Problems

This repository contains solutions to 20 common pattern printing problems, covering stars, numbers, and characters.

## 📚 Patterns Covered
1. Right-angled triangle
code I wrote first:
```
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;
void pattern1(int n){
    for( int i = 0; i<n; i++){
        for(int j = 0; j<i; j++){
            cout<<"*"
        }
    }
    return;
}
int main() {
	// your code goes here
    pattern1();
}
```
###Mistakes
1. ; after cout<<"*"
2. Loop should run j <= i for correct pattern (0 to i)
3. cout << "\n"; // move to next line after each row(after inner for loop.)
4.    int n;
    cin >> n; // Read size of pattern
    pattern1(n);

    Now, you write the correct code

Mistakes you made:
You didn’t pass a value for n in pattern1().

You forgot the semicolon after cout << "*" — C++ requires this.

The inner loop was printing fewer stars than needed (j < i instead of j <= i).

No cout << "\n" after each row.

| i starts at | i condition | j starts at | j condition | Stars per row     |
|-------------|-------------|-------------|-------------|-------------------|
| 0           | `i < n`     | 0           | `j <= i`    | `i + 1` stars     |
| 0           | `i < n`     | 0           | `j < i`     | `i` stars         |
| 1           | `i <= n`    | 0           | `j < i`     | `i - 1` stars     |
| 1           | `i <= n`    | 1           | `j <= i`    | `i - 1` stars ✅  |
