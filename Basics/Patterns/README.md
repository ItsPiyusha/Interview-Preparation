# Why Pattern Printing Matters in DSA
Fundamental building block: Helps master nested loops, spacing logic, and control flow.

Logical thinking: Visualizes output before codingâ€”key for more complex DSA challenges.

Often assessed in entrance-level interviews to test coding fluency and problem breakdown.

# Key Strategy: How to Approach a Pattern Problem
From Reddit and GfG discussions, here are proven tactics to tackle pattern printing systematically:


Draw the pattern manually for a small n (e.g., n=5).

Break it down row by row: count stars, spaces, or characters.

Map indices â†’ values: translate row & column to what should display.

Nested loops structure: outer for rows, inner for columns, with conditions.

Build incrementally: Start with a fixed pattern, then generalize to n.

Validate edge cases: n=1, even vs. odd sizes, large inputs.





# DSA Pattern Printing Problems

This repository contains solutions to 20 common pattern printing problems, covering stars, numbers, and characters.

## ðŸ“š Patterns Covered
1. Right-angled triangle
code I wrote first:
```
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;
void pattern1(int n){
    for( int i = 0; i<n; i++){
        for(int j = 0; j<i; j++){
            cout<<"*"
        }
    }
    return;
}
int main() {
	// your code goes here
    pattern1();
}
```
###Mistakes
1. ; after cout<<"*"
2. Loop should run j <= i for correct pattern (0 to i)
3. cout << "\n"; // move to next line after each row(after inner for loop.)
4.    int n;
    cin >> n; // Read size of pattern
    pattern1(n);

    Now, you write the correct code

Mistakes you made:
You didnâ€™t pass a value for n in pattern1().

You forgot the semicolon after cout << "*" â€” C++ requires this.

The inner loop was printing fewer stars than needed (j < i instead of j <= i).

No cout << "\n" after each row.

| i starts at | i condition | j starts at | j condition | Stars per row     |
|-------------|-------------|-------------|-------------|-------------------|
| 0           | `i < n`     | 0           | `j <= i`    | `i + 1` stars     |
| 0           | `i < n`     | 0           | `j < i`     | `i` stars         |
| 1           | `i <= n`    | 0           | `j < i`     | `i - 1` stars     |
| 1           | `i <= n`    | 1           | `j <= i`    | `i - 1` stars âœ…  |
