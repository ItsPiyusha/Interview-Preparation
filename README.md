couldn't do much, just explained the various branches of Software Engineering to Shubhi.
interviewbit DS interview questions will go for some days may be, I'll try to finish it by this weekend. Today is Tuesday.

DS is how data and the relationship amongst different data is represented, that aids in how efficiently various functions or operations or algorithms can be applied.
<br>
two types of data structures:
<br>
Linear : Arrays, Linked Lists, Stack, Queues
<br>
Non-Linear : Tree, Graph, Table, Set
<br>
a problem is constrained by the space and time complexity within which it has to be solved efficiently.
<br>
The implementation in procedural languages like C is done with the help of structures, pointers, etc.
<br>
In an objected oriented language like Java, data structures are implemented by using classes and objects.
<br>
<strong> 1.Can you explain the difference between file structure and storage structure? </strong>
<br>
File Structure: Representation of data into secondary or auxiliary memory say any device such as hard disk or pen drives that stores data which remains intact until manually deleted is known as a file structure representation.
Storage Structure: In this type, data is stored in the main memory i.e RAM, and is deleted once the function that uses this data gets completely executed.
The difference is that storage structure has data stored in the memory of the computer system, whereas file structure has the data stored in the auxiliary memory.
