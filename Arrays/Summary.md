# ðŸ“š Arrays Patterns Summary â€“ Take U Forward (Striver A2Z DSA Sheet)

A complete structured guide for learning arrays through pattern-based problems from [Take U Forward](https://takeuforward.org/).

---

## âœ… Level 1: Basic Problems / Easy Implementation

- Print all elements
- Find max/min
- Sum of elements
- Search in array
- Insert/delete at index
- Rotate by 1
- Check if array is sorted

---

## âœ… Level 2: Medium Problems / Basic Math + Logic Building

- **Reverse Array / Part of Array**
  - Reverse entire array
  - Reverse from `i` to `j`
  - Left Rotate/Right Rotate by D (Reversal Algo)
- **Swap and Rearrangement**
  - Move all zeros to end
  - Rearrange elements by sign
  - Cyclically rotate an array
  - Sort 0s, 1s, 2s (Dutch National Flag)

---

## âœ… Level 3: Searching / Prefix / Suffix Techniques

- **Prefix Sum / Suffix Sum**
  - Equilibrium index
  - Running sum
  - Longest subarray with sum K
- **Binary Search Patterns**
  - Lower/Upper Bound
  - Search in Rotated Sorted Array
  - Single Element in Sorted Array

---

## âœ… Level 4: Hashing + Frequency Counting

- Count frequency of each element
- Majority Element (>n/2 and >n/3)
- Two Sum
- Longest Consecutive Sequence

---

## âœ… Level 5: Sliding Window + Two Pointer

- **Fixed Window Size**
  - Max/Min of all subarrays of size K
  - First negative integer in every window
- **Variable Window Size**
  - Longest subarray with at most K distinct elements
  - Longest substring without repeating characters
- **Two Pointers**
  - Pair with given sum
  - Container with Most Water
  - Trapping Rainwater

---

## âœ… Level 6: Sorting Techniques

- **Sorting + Greedy + Custom Comparator**
  - Merge Intervals
  - Chocolate Distribution Problem
  - Largest Number Formed from Array
- **Merge Sort Inversions**
  - Count inversions
  - Smallest missing positive number

---

## âœ… Level 7: Advanced Patterns

- **Kadaneâ€™s Algorithm**
