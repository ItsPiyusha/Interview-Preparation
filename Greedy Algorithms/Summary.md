# ðŸ§  Greedy Algorithms - Patterns & Problems

Greedy algorithms make a locally optimal choice at each step with the hope that it leads to a globally optimal solution. They are often used when **the problem has an optimal substructure and a greedy choice property**.

## ðŸ“š Key Greedy Patterns

### 1. **Activity Selection / Interval Scheduling**
Select the maximum number of non-overlapping intervals.

- [Maximum Number of Events That Can Be Attended (LC #1353)](https://leetcode.com/problems/maximum-number-of-events-that-can-be-attended/)
- [Non-overlapping Intervals (LC #435)](https://leetcode.com/problems/non-overlapping-intervals/)

### 2. **Fractional Knapsack**
Take the most valuable items first based on ratio of value/weight.

### 4. **Job Sequencing Problem**
Schedule jobs to maximize profit before deadlines.

### 5. **Minimum Platforms / Overlapping Intervals**
Find the minimum resources (like platforms) required.

### 6. **Greedy Jumping / Reaching Goal**
Make minimum steps or jumps using a greedy decision at each step.

### 7. **Greedy for String Problems**
Make lexicographically smallest/largest results using stack + greedy logic.

### 8. **Greedy Coins / Money Change**
Use the largest denominations first.

### 9. **Gas Station Problems**
Greedily simulate circular tours.

### 10. **Greedy for Scheduling / Timelines**
Greedy choice of start/end time, or deadlines.

## ðŸ§  Tips to Identify Greedy Problems

- Problem asks for **maximum/minimum** (profit, events, jobs, platforms).
- Choices can be **sorted** based on some key property (start time, profit, deadline).
- Often solvable with **heap**, **sort**, and **greedy condition check**.
- Dynamic programming might work too, but greedy is **more efficient** if applicable.
